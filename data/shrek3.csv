2415.359,2416.519,"SHREK Artie?"
2420.798,2422.561,"SHIP CAPTAIN There goes my hip!"
2422.7,2424.861,"SHREK Artie! What are you doing?"
2426.804,2428.931,"ARTIE What does it look like?!"
2431.609,2434.077,"SHREK This really isn't up to you."
2434.211,2437.078,"ARTIE I don't know anything about being king!"
2437.214,2439.148,"SHREK You'll learn on the job!"
2441.051,2443.576,"ARTIE Sorry to disapoint you, but I'm going back."
2443.721,2446.155,"SHREK Back to what? Being a loser?"
2449.727,2451.285,"SHREK Now look what you did!"
2452.062,2455.896,"ARTIE Look what I did? Who's holding the wheel, chief?"
2456.901,2458.391,"SHREK Shrek!"
2470.748,2472.739,"SHIP CAPTAIN Land ho!"
2485.262,2487.093,"PUSS How humiliating."
2488.098,2491.033,"SHREK Oh, nice going, Your Highness."
2491.168,2494.865,"ARTIE Now it's ""Your Highness""? What happened to ""loser""?"
2495.005,2497.906,"SHREK If you think this is geting you out of anything, well it isn't."
2498.042,2501.808,"SHREK We're heading back to Far Far Away one way or another..."
2501.946,2504.38,"SHREK ...and you're going to be a father!"
2504.515,2505.948,"ARTIE What?"
2506.784,2508.342,"DONKEY You just said ""father""."
2508.485,2511.215,"SHREK King! You're going to be king!"
2511.355,2514.347,"ARTIE ""You're going to be king!"" Yeah, right."
2515.559,2516.992,"Where do you think you are going?"
2517.127,2519.595,"ARTIE Far Far Away... from you!"
2519.73,2521.698,"SHREK You get back here, young man, and I mean it !"
2523.667,2526.158,"PUSS Boss? I don't think he's coming back."
2526.303,2529.5,"PUSS Maybe it's for the best. He's not exactly king material."
2529.64,2532.871,"DONKEY When did you plan to tell him you were supposed to be king?"
2533.01,2535.843,"SHREK Come on. Why would I do that?"
2535.98,2539.04,"SHREK Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me."
2539.183,2543.142,"DONKEY Then you're gonna change your tactics if you want to get anywhere with him."
2545.489,2547.32,"SHREK You're right, Donkey."
2549.66,2551.184,"SHREK What about this?"
2551.328,2555.162,"SHREK & DONKEY - Shrek! - Come on. It's just a joke."
2556.734,2558.065,"SHREK Still..."
2574.852,2576.513,"SHREK Listen, Artie."
2577.087,2582.218,"SHREK If you think this whole mad scene ain't dope, I feel you, dude."
2582.359,2586.489,"SHREK I'm not trying to get up in your grill or raise your roof, or whatever."
2586.63,2588.757,"SHREK But what I am screamin' is, yo..."
2588.899,2592.096,"SHREK ...check out this kazing thazing, bazaby!"
2592.236,2594.329,"SHREK If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying"
2594.471,2597.406,"SHEK ain't straight trippin', say, ""Oh, no, you didn't!"
2597.541,2599.975,"SHREK You're getting on my last nerve."""
2600.11,2603.102,"SHREK And then I'll know it's... I'll know it's wack!"
2604.715,2605.909,"ARTIE Somebody, help!"
2606.05,2609.451,"ARTIE I've been kidnapped by a monster who's trying to relate to me!"
2609.586,2613.215,"SHREK & ARTIE - Artie, wait. - Come on! Help! Hello?"
2614.725,2618.422,"MERLIN Greetings, cosmic children of the universe."
2618.562,2620.496,"MERLIN Welcome to my serenity circle."
2620.631,2624.761,"MERLIN Please leave any bad vibes outside the healing vortex."
2624.902,2626.733,"MERLIN Now prepare to..."
2632.409,2635.242,"MERLIN I knew I should have got that warranty!"
2638.148,2639.615,"ARTIE Mr. Merlin?"
2639.75,2641.217,"SHREK You know this guy?"
2641.351,2645.617,"ARTIE Yeah. He was the school magic teacher, until he had his nervous breakdown."
2645.756,2649.123,"MERLIN Technically, I was merely a victim of a level 3 fatigue."
2649.259,2651.352,"MERLIN At the request of my therapist,"
2651.495,2655.124,"MERLIN and the school authorities, I retired to the tranquility of nature"
2655.265,2657.426,"MERLIN to discover my divine purpose."
2658.936,2662.337,"MERLIN Now, can I interest anyone in a snack or beverage?"
2662.473,2663.565,"SHREK Uh, no."
2663.707,2667.04,"MERLIN Sure you don't want to try my famous Rock Au Gratin?"
2669.947,2671.414,"MERLIN It's organic."
2671.548,2673.982,"SHREK Thanks. I just ate a boulder on the way in."
2674.118,2677.053,"SHREK What we need, are directions back back to Far Far Away."
2677.187,2679.712,"ARTIE ""We""? Who said I was going with you?"
2679.857,2684.226,"SHREK I did. People are counting on you, so don't try to weasel out of it."
2684.361,2686.42,"ARTIE If it's such a great job, you do it."
2686.964,2691.23,"SHREK Understand this, kid. It's no more Mr. Nice Guy from here on out."
2691.368,2693.666,"ARTIE So, that was your Mr. Nice Guy?"
2693.804,2695.738,"SHREK Yeah, and I'm going to miss him."
2695.873,2700.276,"ARTIE You know what ? Why don't you go terrorize a village and leave me alone!"
2700.41,2704.938,"SHREK Was that a crack about ogres? You get your royal highness to Far Far Away..."
2705.082,2709.109,"SHREK ...before I kick it there! Now, which way am I kicking?"
2709.253,2711.084,"MERLIN I could have tell you, but since you're"
2711.221,2713.746,"MERLIN in the midst of a self-destructive rage spiral,"
2713.891,2716.416,"MERLIN it would be karmically irresponsible."
2716.56,2720.223,"SHREK Self-destructive? Look, are you going to help us or not?"
2720.364,2722.958,"MERLIN Most definitely, but only after you"
2723.1,2726.297,"MERLIN take the journey to your soul!"
2726.436,2727.801,"SHREK Yeah, I don't think so."
2727.938,2731.772,"MERLIN It's either that or some primal scream therapy."
2733.844,2736.506,"SHREK All right, all right. Journey to the soul."
2737.347,2739.212,"MERLIN Now, all of you,"
2739.349,2741.874,"MERLIN look into the Fire of Truth"
2742.019,2745.011,"MERLIN and tell me what you see."
2747.858,2749.723,"DONKEY Ooh, charades!"
2749.86,2754.627,"DONKEY Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls!"
2754.765,2757.359,"MERLIN Okay, monster... go for it."
2766.043,2767.738,"SHREK I see a rainbow pony."
2767.878,2769.812,"MERLIN Excellent work! Now the boy."
2769.947,2771.414,"ARTIE This is lame."
2771.548,2773.812,"MERLIN You're lame! Now just go for it."
2775.385,2776.716,"ARTIE Okay."
2777.554,2781.991,"ARTIE There's a baby bird and a father bird siting in a nest."
2782.125,2784.116,"MERLIN Yes! Stay with it!"
2784.962,2788.955,"ARTIE The dad just flew away. Why did he leave the little bird all alone?"
2789.633,2793.069,"ARTIE It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to."
2793.971,2796.132,"ARTIE It's going to fall!"
2800.978,2804.971,"MERLIN Proper head case you are. Really messed up."
2808.318,2813.312,"ARTIE Okay, I get it. The bird's me. My dad left. So what?"
2825.335,2827.997,"SHREK Look, Artie, um..."
2832.342,2835.106,"SHREK Just thought I'd help set the mood..."
2835.245,2838.578,"SHREK ...for your big heart-to-heart chat."
2847.024,2850.357,"SHREK I know what it's like to not feel ready for something."
2852.696,2855.028,"SHREK Even ogres get scared."
2855.866,2858.699,"SHREK You know... once in a while."
2860.704,2864.47,"ARTIE I know you want me to be king, but I can't."
2864.608,2867.475,"ARTIE I'm not cut out for it, and I never will be, all right?"
2868.378,2870.869,"ARTIE Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth the trouble."
2871.014,2874.211,"ARTIE He dumped me at that school the first chance he got..."
2874.885,2877.217,"ARTIE ...and I never heard from him again."
2878.889,2882.723,"SHREK My dad wasn't really the fatherly type, either."
2883.226,2885.387,"ARTIE Well, I doubt he was worse than mine."
2886.229,2887.526,"SHREK Oh, yeah?"
2887.664,2891.725,"SHREK My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me."
2892.569,2894.764,"SHREK Now I guess I should have seen it coming."
2894.905,2899.171,"SHREK He bathed me in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth."
2901.078,2903.569,"ARTIE Okay, I guess that's pretty bad."
2905.916,2908.111,"SHREK you know, it may be hard to believe,"
2908.251,2911.709,"SHREK what, with my obvious charm and good looks,"
2911.855,2914.79,"SHREK but people used to think I was a monster."
2914.925,2918.588,"SHREK And for a long time, I believed them."
2920.597,2922.189,"SHREK But after a while,"
2922.332,2925.859,"SHREK you learn to ignore the names people call you"
2926.003,2928.335,"SHREK and you just trust who you are."
2930.44,2933.603,"ARTIE You know... you're okay, Shrek."
2934.444,2938.005,"ARTIE You just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap."
2939.349,2940.976,"SHREK Thanks, Artie."
2941.118,2944.781,"ARTIE The soap's because you stink... really bad."
2945.956,2948.447,"SHREK Yeah... I got that."
2952.462,2955.329,"CINDERELLA This place is filthy!"
2955.632,2957.224,"CINDERELLA I feel like a hobo."
2958.468,2961.232,"SNOW WHITE I'm sorry, but this isn't just working for me."
2961.371,2965.933,"SLEEPING BEAUTY Everything's always about you, isn't it. Something in your attitude is not helping."
2966.076,2969.773,"SNOW WHITE Maybe it just bothers you I was voted fairest in the land."
2969.913,2972.006,"RAPUNZEL Oh you mean in that rigged election?"
2972.149,2975.118,"SNOW WHITE Oh give me a break. ""Rapunzel, Rapunzel..."
2975.252,2978.38,"SNOW WHITE ...let down thy golden extensions!"""
2978.522,2983.323,"QUEEN Ladies, let go of your pety complaints and let's work together!"
2986.296,2989.288,"SNOW WHITE So I guess the plan is we just wander aimlessly"
2989.433,2991.526,"SNOW WHITE in this stinkhole until we rot."
2991.668,2995.195,"FIONA No, we get inside and find out what Charming's up to."
2995.338,2998.034,"DORIS I know he's a jerk and everything,"
2998.175,3002.339,"DORIS but that Charming makes me hotter than July."
3003.68,3005.011,"FIONA That's it!"
3033.043,3035.409,"RAPUNZEL Come on! This way!"
3035.545,3036.534,"FIONA Rapunzel, wait!"
3046.056,3047.887,"FIONA Charming, let go of her."
3048.024,3050.652,"PRINCE CHARMING But why would I want to do that?"
3056.199,3057.188,"FIONA What?"
3057.334,3062.431,"PRINCE CHARMING Say hello, ladies, to the new Queen of Far Far Away."
3066.443,3068.24,"FIONA Rapunzel, how could you?"
3068.378,3070.642,"RAPUNZEL Jealous much?"
3070.78,3073.214,"PRINCE CHARMING Soon you'll be back where you started,"
3073.35,3075.978,"PRINCE CHARMING scrubbing floors or locked away in towers."
3076.119,3079.748,"PRINCE CHARMING That is, if I let you last the week."
3082.058,3084.652,"RAPUNZEL But Pookie, you promised not to hurt them."
3084.794,3088.787,"PRINCE CHARMING Not here, kitten whiskers. Daddy will discuss it later."
3089.533,3092.058,"PRINCE CHARMING Now forgive us. We have a show to put on."
3092.202,3095.467,"FIONA Shrek will be back soon, Charming and you'll be sorry."
3095.605,3097.004,"PRINCE CHARMING Sorry?!"
3097.14,3101.406,"PRINCE CHARMING Don't you realize once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away..."
3101.545,3103.308,"PRINCE CHARMING ...he's doomed?"
3142.852,3144.479,"DONKEY Look out! They got a piano!"
3144.621,3147.988,"CAPTAIN HOOK Kill them all... except the fat one."
3148.124,3152.493,"CAPTAIN HOOK King Charming has something special in mind for you, ogre."
3152.629,3153.926,"SHREK King Charming?"
3154.064,3155.088,"CAPTAIN HOOK Attack!"
3161.371,3162.531,"SHREK Artie, duck!"
3177.087,3178.349,"CAPTAIN HOOK Ready the plank!"
3194.07,3195.731,"DONKEY & ARTIE - Shrek! - Help!"
3215.058,3216.355,"CAPTAIN HOOK Cowards!"
3216.493,3218.859,"SHREK What has Charming done with Fiona?"
3218.995,3221.589,"CAPTAIN HOOK She's gonna get what's coming to her."
3222.165,3227.068,"CAPTAIN HOOK And there ain't nothing you can do to stop him!"
3227.203,3229.728,"PUSS & DONKEY - We've got to save her. - But she's so far far away!"
3230.674,3232.972,"SHREK Get yourself back to Worcestershire, kid."
3233.109,3236.601,"ARTIE No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've got an idea."
3236.746,3239.01,"MERLIN I am a buzzing bee."
3239.683,3242.88,"ARTIE Mr. Merlin? They need a spell to get them..."
3243.019,3246.045,"ARTIE ...I mean us, back to Far Far Away."
3246.189,3249.625,"MERLIN Forget it. I don't have that kind of magic in me anymore, kid."
3249.759,3253.456,"MERLIN How about a hug? That's the best kind of magic."
3253.596,3255.962,"ARTIE Mr merlin, please. I know you can do it."
3256.099,3257.896,"MERLIN I said forget it!"
3258.034,3259.365,"ARTIE But..."
3266.776,3268.368,"MERLIN What's with you?"
3269.713,3272.876,"ARTIE It's just so hard, you know?"
3273.55,3277.68,"ARTIE They really need to get back, 'cause their kingdom's in trouble."
3277.821,3280.346,"ARTIE 'Cause there's a really bad man."
3280.49,3282.253,"ARTIE And it's just so hard!"
3282.392,3284.519,"MERLIN Take it easy."
3284.661,3288.028,"ARTIE No! I don't think you understand!"
3288.164,3292.692,"ARTIE There's a mean person doing mean things to good people."
3292.836,3294.531,"SHREK Have a heart, old man."
3294.671,3298.835,"ARTIE They really need your help to get them back. So why won't you help them?!"
3302.679,3304.271,"MERLIN Okay."
3304.414,3306.405,"MERLIN I'll go get my things."
3309.185,3310.379,"ARTIE Piece of cake."
3310.52,3314.047,"SHREK Well, well. You want eggs with that ham?"
3314.19,3317.887,"MERLIN I am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects."
3318.027,3319.494,"DONKEY & MERLIN - Side effects? - Don't worry."
3319.629,3323.395,"MERLIN Whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful it may be,"
3323.533,3326.696,"MERLIN it will wear off eventually. I think."
3328.671,3330.901,"MERLIN & DONKEY - Oops. - Are you sure this is a good idea?"
3331.04,3335.17,"SHREK Look, if Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me."
3335.311,3337.176,"SHREK Even if his robe doesn't quite cover..."

3377.52,3382.514,"DONKEY Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!"
3384.861,3388.922,"PUSS At least you don't look like some kind of bloated roasted pinata!"
3389.065,3391.124,"PUSS You should think about going on a diet!"
3391.267,3395.863,"DONKEY You should get yourself a pair of pants. I feel all exposed and nasty!"
3397.54,3399.872,"DONKEY So you two think this is funny?"
3402.378,3404.175,"ARTIE I'm really sorry, guys."
3404.314,3406.782,"SHREK Don't be. You got us back, kid."
3412.455,3414.582,"DONKEY How in the Hans Christian Andersen"
