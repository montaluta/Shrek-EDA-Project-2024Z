# Shrek Project

## 📊 Project Description

This project was conducted as part of the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** course for the **Bachelor's program in Mathematics and Data Analysis** at **Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science**, during the **Summer Semester 2024**.  

The analysis focuses on *Shrek 2* and *3* dialogues and includes several aspects:  

- **Speaking rate of characters**  
- **Connections between characters** based on dialogues  
- **Distributions of the number of words in a single speech**  
- **Income in dollars divided by GDP**  

All analyses were performed in **R**, and the results were later used to create a poster summarizing the findings.
